Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#999 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.343 ns between processor/data_mem/memory_file_reg_0_5/CLKBWRCLK (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and processor/data_mem/memory_file_reg_1_1/ADDRBWRADDR[5] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1000 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.541 ns between processor/data_mem/memory_file_reg_0_5/CLKBWRCLK (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and processor/data_mem/memory_file_reg_0_1/ADDRBWRADDR[5] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on UART_RX_in relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on UART_TX_out relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_wizard/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clk_wiz_0, clkfbout_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_wizard/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_clk_wiz_0, clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_wizard/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out2_clk_wiz_0, clk_out2_clk_wiz_0_1
